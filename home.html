<p class="mee-siam-red"><u>Nijika is a paragon of virtue</u><br/><b>Who is Nijika? For the blind, she is vision. For the hungry, she is the chef. For the thirsty, she is water. If Nijika thinks, I agree. If Nijika speaks, I'm listening. If Nijika has a million fans, I am one of them. If Nijika has ten fans, I am one of them. If Nijika has only one fan, that is me. If Nijika has no fans, I no longer exist. If the whole world is against Nijika, I am against the whole world. I will love Nijika until my very last breath.</b></p>
<p><u>Xiangling impact</u><br/><i>I can't take it anymore. I'm sick of xiangling. I try to play diluc. My xiangling deals more damage. I try to play yoimiya. My xiangling deals more damage. I try to play Hu tao. My xiangling deals more damage. I want to play Klee. Her best team has xiangling. I want to play raiden, childe. They both want xiangling.
    She grabs me by the throat. I fish for her. I cook for her. I give her the catch. She isn't satisfied. I pull engulfing lightning. "I don't need this much er" She tells me. "Give me more field time." She grabs bennett and forces him to throw himself off enemies. "You just need to funnel me more. I can deal more damage with homa."
    I can't pull for homa, I don't have enough primogems. She grabs my credit card. It declines. "Guess this is the end." She grabs gouba. She says "Gouba, get them." There is no hint of sadness in his eyes. Nothing but pure, no icd pyro application. What a cruel world.</i></p>
    
    <p class="money"><u>Invest in Wuji stonks</u><br/><i>"You are right, Mahito. I am you. I wanted to reject you. Convince myself that you were wrong. But that doesn't matter now. I'm gonna kill you. Even if you come back as another curse, I will kill you. Change your name. Change your form. I will kill you again. I don't need to find meaning or a reason. Maybe a hundred years after my death, the meaning behind my actions will become apparent. In the grand scheme of things, I'm probably nothing more than a cog. But I will keep killing curses for as long as I can. That is my role in all this."-Wuji</i></p>
